When a beam of light (white beam) strikes a mirror, the mirror 

reflects the light beam, so that the reflected light makes an 

angle with the normal (red beam) that is equal to the angle of 

the incident ray. This reflection phenomenon is represented by 

this equation:       (Theta)'1 = (Theta)1	

where (Theta) is the angle between the ray and the normal line.
